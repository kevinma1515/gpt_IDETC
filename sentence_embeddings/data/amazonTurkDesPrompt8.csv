"This device will have a huge market in the hospitality industry. It will save so much labor costs (something that will be very important if the morons who flunked economics raise the minimum wage to $15/hour). Imagine folding thousands of towels and wash cloths with this machine. Quality will be uniform. They will be folded much faster. With some modifications to the process, you can create fascinating folds for dinner napkins (making them like birds, flowers, etc.). Another market for this device will be textile manufacturers who will use it to prepare their products for shipment to retail outlets. Clothing stores (e.g., The GAP) may be another target market."
