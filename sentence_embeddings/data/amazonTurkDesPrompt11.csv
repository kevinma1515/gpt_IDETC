An energy meter that plugs into an outlet that reads energy usage through electrical power and sends data wirelessly to your smartphone to monitor it
A way to link the home exercise device to the home generator.
"it would be nice if someone came up with a switch that could turn off all the non essential electic/electronic devices in the house. In that way we could be having almost no energy usage when nobody is home. one switch to cut power to lights, tv, computer etc"
"A device that creates energy by converting things you use on a daily basis into energy. For example, any motion caused by blowing air, appliances, opening and shutting doors, toilet flushing, etc. Absorbing the energy somehow from these actions and recycling it into the energy usage of the home."
The device that i would use would be a device that turns our trash into electrical power by harnessing the heat that it causes while destroying the trash. I would have a type of container that either burns or so ehow destroys all of the trash that we throw away and harnesses the heat from the exothermic reaction caused during the destruction of the trash into electrical energy.
A stationary bicycle that can be pedaled and will generate power to run a household appliance such as a television or a lamp.
"A device that connects to your home's circuit breaker and turns everything off when you leave, but turns it all back on when you get home."
I thought of a device that turns off appliances when you aren't using them.
A control panel in your bedroom that allows you turn off power in certain parts of the house before you go to bed. That way any lights or appliances you accidentally left on will be turned off.
"Some kind of sensor that will be set up in each room, and can detect three things: is the room occupied, are the lights turned on, and is the ceiling fan turned on. Notify a smartphone app if the lights or fan is on and the room has been unoccupied for 5 minutes or more (time limit is user-configurable and can be different for each room)."
"by allowing the owner the ability to easily see what devices are using the most electricity, so that the owner could manage the devices accordingly."
"A wall mount device, similar to a thermometer, to register flow of hot and cold air, drafts, water leaks, lighting, etc"
"A device that attaches to the power usage monitor and can tell which appliances/electronics are using the most electricity in the house, much like on a smartphone you can see which apps or processes are draining the battery life the most. This would allow the home owner to identify which appliances are draining energy or which lights are being left on at inappropriate times."
Computer controlled outlets. Every outlet in the home has a tiny android device in it that connects to wi-fi. The outlets can be programmed to only work at certain hours.
electronic remotes that do not require batteries.
home screens
"Some type of device, like maybe a motion sensor, that will turn off or reduce the air Connor heat when the room is not in use for a while.  They have something similar for lights."
"A bloom box that is stored in the home basement.Solar panels utilized for production, and a battery packcontaining energy storage. Wind turbine generators locatedon either rooftop or on property's ground."
"Conservation of energy is extremely difficult these days due to technology. I would use create a device that only allows for lights to be on and automatically adjust to minimum need when a person enters a room and turns off when they leave. Another way for energy conservation is to use gravity fed water systems, of course that means building a home below the water source. This would reduce the strain on the water regulator and pump system, thus conserving energy."
"This device is a device that you plug into your wall outlets. It acts as an ""idling"" passthrough to whatever you're plugging in. Basically, if you have a device that never turns off unless you hit the off button, this device would turn it off automatically after a certain amount of time when it is unused."
"The meterAfter six o'clock pm the meter can dim lights, shut off lights, lower air temps go green. Can connect through a light company or a box connected to the lights."
A new type of insulation that would allow a house to be cool with out using so much air conditioning or warm with out using the heat.
Insulating drapery
"The widespread implementation of a new, efficient solar panel / photovoltaic screens."
A sensor on the Power meter that sounds an alarm when you have gone over a certain power usage then producing your average number to maintain.
"An automatic electrical devices that turns off products when not in use after a certain length of time.  Each room would have this device installed in it.  If you are in the kitchen and have not used an appliance that can can be turned off with not in use, this would conserve energy.  You should not have to plugged and unplugged each item in your house at each use.  That is ridiculous.  It should be like an electrical device that is in each room and you can program it to list all devices in your room and set a timer to stop the flow of electric to this device.  Once you touch the device electric currency will again flow."
Window blinds that are backed in a reflective material that faces outwards.
"A thin removable film that can be applied to large windows that blocks out infrared radiation, thereby decreasing heat absorption and leading to decreased usage of air conditioning in the summer. The film should be removable so that in the winter it can allow sunlight to better heat a room. It should be clear and not have tinting to block out visible light."
"A robotic insect that flies through the air and turns off each appliance that can save energy.   It will be preprogrammed to know what exactly you want turned off and when.   It will be in the shape of a very large bumblebee, with mechanical wings and a beak favoring a hummingbird, that works as a clamp."
"There could be a little smart buddy system thing installed all over the house. It could detect things like a light left on when no one is there, or water running past a timed limit. It would send notifications to the users phone so that they would remember to conserve energy."
"automatic light switch, motion detected"
"A product called shade out. It can be a very cheap black sheet-like object to place over things such as windows or other places the sun can come into direct contact with the house to heat up the house. If you can keep the heat of the house dowm, then you don't have to run your AC that often and therefore, conserves energy."
"A way to easily control which rooms are being heated or cooled. A control pad that lets one shut off the heating and cooling vents in rooms that are not being used. A display that shows which rooms are currently being heated or cooled, that lets the user turn on or off climate controls in different rooms."
"A small device that can be used to detect what devices in the house are using the most energy. If one can detect that device1 is using 25% of the household's total current energy usage, versus device using 10%, the homeowner can then determine that device1 should be unplugged or disabled when not in use, because it is using a large portion of the household energy."
"A device that a homeowner can use to check the energy leakage from their windows, doors, etc. It could be designed to have an app where you can load the information to your computer and maybe to your utility company's website. You could then monitor the leakage and know when a window or door needs new seals or needs to be replaced."
"Master off button for all electronics that ""waste"" electricity when not in use that can be placed near the main exit door."
"A device that can monitor all types of energy being used and sort it all out. So the homeowner can know how much lights have been on, appliances plugged in, heat has been used in different types of areas (laundry, dishwasher, sink), and any other uses of energy. This way someone could tell where they overused or where they could cut down."
My idea is to develop solar powered cell phones and smart devices. All our electronics consume  so much power
"there could be a device that you sit in a central area. it would have different seasonal modes. you would select summer, winter, fall, whatever. if it is on winter for instance, it would have sensors to indicate like when a window or door is opened, when there is a draft from somewhere. it could be wired for an audible alert or connected to the television system somehow where there could be a notice on the screen. the same way when someone calls and the caller id shows up on the television"
"A foot powered dishwasher that has a pedal to power water through the plates, flatware, cups, etc."
"A small box designed in the vein of a motion detector attaches to your wall. Anytime someone leaves the room and the room is empty, it beeps (or sings or chirps) to remind the person to turn off the light."
A home control center that can detect and control different types of utilities throughout the home.
A device that automatically turns lights off at a certain time of night in case anyone left them on before going to sleep
a skylight which gathers solar energy and can disperse it throughout the residence automatically to other devices
Nano bots which absorb movement across static planes which residents pass through to generate resistance therefore energy.
a laser sensor which detects pheromone signatures which will connect to the thermostat and turn off when it does not sense humans are around.
"A contraption of some sorts that can decrease the energy used on the refrigerator when it is not full, or open."
A device that can help you controll the amount of energy you use in the house
"Automatic shutters that open and close with the temperature.  Perfect for keeping heat in and letting air in, uses sunlight to warm the house and wind energy to cool it."
"Energy from fans is captured and recycled back into the electricity pool for the home. The lead is hooked onto the fans, and run to the conversion station, from there, it its attatced to the electrictiy source for the home."
My idea is a filtration system that converts the carbon dioxide that humans breathe out can be converted into usable energy. It would be installed throughout the house and would transform carbon dioxide into energy that can be used to power devices or services throughout the house.
"A device that filters excess water in the sink. Whether it be the cold water that you let run down the drain while you are waiting for the water to get hot, excess water in the sink after washing dishes. Not sure where it would go. Maybe next to the garbage disposal."
"the home bot.  Whenever this robot detects people wasting energy, it reminds them of helpful ways to save energy.  It doesnt need to be a large robot, it could just be a voice."
"They have plastic film you can put over windows to prevent leaking air, but they are hard to put on, and don't work completely. I think they should make wooden shutters for the insides of windows like they do for the outside of windows. They should completely cover the window all the way to the walls, preventing any side leaks. Then people could completely cover windows at night when it is colder, but open the inside shutters easily during the daytime for more natural light. It could be hard to do this with outside shutters at night if there is snow or ice or be dangerous, and inside shutters would be easier to use."
"When your bathtub is leaking, there is a motion sensor behind the tap that sees the drops and notifies you via an alert in the kitchen. This saves water heat energy."
"For small rooms like bathrooms and closets, a device similar in size and appearance to a basketball pump would be attached between the door and the wall, or hung from the wall near where the light switch would be. When the door is opened or moved or the ""plunger"" pulled, the device would be ""cocked"", using a spring for kinetic force, released at a slow rate, and using air pressure or direct gear force to power a small generator outputting enough power for one light bulb for set amounts of time."
An outside solar panel that charges a battery that the home can use in multiple inside power outlets.
this device could use unspent energy to absorb extra heat or light and convert and store it for later use.
"A ""Live Switch"" that shuts off latent power to the entire home when you are not home.  Alot of energy is wasted, idle in appliances that are ""off"" yet still leach energy.  The ""Live Switch"" would work the opposite of a Manual Switch used in power outages.  The ""Live Switch"" shuts off all the power to the breaker box and routes a single power line/cord/plug hub to the home to power select appliances directly.  Key items are powered but less energy is wasted."
"A device that would restrict the total amount of power that can be delivered to the home at a time. When the maximum limit is reached, no more devices could be turned on, and the least critical devices would be turned off."
"device senses when people are absent or present, adjusting room temp and lighting accordingly"
"An energy-use meter that could be centrally located and indicate usage for various utilities (water, electricity, gas) would be great to have. It could have a removable drive for manual downloading, or a chip that could work over wifi, etc. Being able to see month-over-month and/or year-over-year would be helpful as well."
"A box that shuts down unnessary power sucking devices when not in use--even if plugged it it senses that the device is draining power and cuts off electricity to that device until it is turned on again. It is also programmable so you can unpower your house at times you choose (while you're gone or sleeping, etc)"
"It would be an electronic regulator that cut off lights, fans  etc.. after a  certain amount of energy is used and then send a single to the home owner and have them reset their power consumption if they needed to, other wise only designated items would have power going to them at any given time."
"The device would connect to your electrical panel and receive data from the electrical meter to analyze the use of electricity in the home. The data would be evaluated using the time of the day that usage was at its highest and could even have an app for the homeowner to indication vacationing days, work schedule, etc. to help in the evaluation process. Home owners could then receive tips via the app or email for ways they could change their energy habits to aid in conservation."
The device analyzes the amount of energy consumed every appliance in the home. Electricity costs scanner
a device that can help conserve is styrofoam.
"This device shuts down all electricity to all the outlets that don't have essential items such as a refrigerator plugged it. The device acts using blue tooth. When a person walks in their home with the Bluetooth fab the energy conservation device allows electricity, when they leave it shuts down the power."
A personal monitor that keeps track of energy use in different rooms and notifies you verbally (like in an automated voice) when you are using more than a set threshold.  It can also tell you specifics room by room how much energy is used in each room.
"A smartphone app that allows you to turn off appliances in your home when you are away. For example, if you have forgotten the AC on and left the house for the day, you can use the app to connect to your device at home and turn it off."
"A master switch that turns off any specified non-essential devices in the house, to ensure you are leaving nothing on before you go to bed or go out the door"
"A spray that coats int interior of a home with a substance that fills cracks that can pass energy, but is invisible to the eye."
A treadmill that generates electricity to run lights instead of normal power sources.
A full shade that covers the roof of a house to shield it against the sun.
A device that can figure out when somebody left a room and will turn off lights automatically
"Programmable shades on windows.  Just like you can program your thermostat you could program your shades. And they would not need to be pretty shades on the inside, more utilitarian.  They would close when you said so, and open when you said so, and there would be an easy chart so that you could program them to open on winter, sunny days, and close on summer, hot days."
"This is small wall-mounted device, much like your thermostat. What this does is simply track your energy usage per room. It'll show your energy per KW/hr, which rooms using most, and use previous data to compare your energy to your previous energy usage, and to your neighbors. This will help in the same way that watching your bank account fluctuate dictates how much money you send"
This device would connect with your power meter and communicate and collect information on all other devices. It would detect when electricity was used during the day along with activity used during the day. Reports will be sent with information on which rooms consume the most energy  and provide recommendations on how to reduce it.
an automatic movement detector that turns light off if no movement is depicted
Cup that heats water in it
Outlets that can be set to shut off at certain times of the day or night in case something is accidentally left on when someone is at work or asleep. Can be configured with an app.
A thermostat or device supplied by the energy company that helps monitor the usage of heat and other energy powered resources in the home. Can be viewed even away from the home.
A timer that turns off things when not in use for a certain amount of time
"a solar powered batter for your home, like you would have on your car."
"The device consists of a series of small meters that are connected to each power outlet. The meter wirelessly relays the power consumption of each outlet to a program installed on a personal computer. The meters can be labelled for each appliance, for instance ""computer,"" ""television,"" ""toaster,"" etc. The program will monitor daily power usage for each appliance to provide the household with data on its energy-usage. Appliances could be compared to average, and scenarios to save power could be considered. The program could also identify the largest energy-usage culprits in a household."
"A solar panel, somehow connected to the power source, in which, it can signal when it has enough solar energy to run the entire homes electrical needs, until it runs out of 'juice' and needs to return the home to its electrical source while it 'fuels' up."
app that tracks all power use
"a micro turbine that is placed inline between your water main and the house. When ever you run water in your house, the flow of water from the water main would spin the little turbine to product electricity. The turbine would have to regulate its resistance as to not obstruct the water pressure too much. The amount of electricity it can produce would be dependent on the home's available water pressure."
a sealant that fixes the cracks around older doors and windows without having to replace them
"Learning outlets. Outlets only power devices like televisions, lamps, etc when a person is in the room."
"An app on your phone that would detect which areas in the house you use the most, which devices you use the most, and where most of your energy is spent.  You could turn off devices in unused areas, and learn which things use the most energy."
"A small robot that plugs into your electrical system, regulating the flow of energy for maximum efficiency."
A fridge and freezer with glass doors that only stays open for 10 seconds.  You can see inside all the time so it wont take long staring and thinking what to eat
"Something that could be used to section off areas of the house, like a removable wall, or draft proof remove able doors at the ends of hallways that could allow you to heat or cool specific areas without wasting energy"
the device would me something that gets power and energy from oxygen. the device will work by collecting air and using it to save energy in the entire house.
System that automatically shuts off things that use power that aren't in use
"Water heater that cycles on and off to agree with ones sleep schedule. The water heater would restart prior to your wake up time so you would have hot water for daily preparations, but not waste the electricity keeping water hot when it is not being used. The tank is insulated so even when the water heater is off, the tank will retain hot water for a period of time, not sure how long, depends on the size of the tank. the hot water heater is probably the largest user of electricity in one's home."
This is very easy. You would make a magnetic motor. You use a tiny bit of electricity to get it going (you don't actually need any) and you use repelling magnets to keep the motor(wheel) going. This energy will last indefinitely. The issue is just storing it in a battery and routing it throughout the house. Also keeping the motor well oiled and maximizing electricity per rotation is critical. You could essentially sell the electric company money back with the excess or use their electricity for backup. It would be nice to use the motor as an on demand source but that would take some thinking and serious power. Feel free to hire me or pay me royalties as I am an in debt college grad!
"An energy monitor wired to the power main that measures energy usage of every item plugged in, keeping homeowners informed on how much energy is being consumed and where they can cut back. It allows homeowners to schedule reduce energy during certain times of day."
This would be a type of heat sync that would store energy from the air in your house when it raised or lowered beyond a certain threshold and would then use that energy in a way similar to geothermal energy cycled back into the system.
