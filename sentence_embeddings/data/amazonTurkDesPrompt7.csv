Having a device on your phone that is able to sense what is around you and alerts you when  something is close or thinks you might be walking into something.  This would be like sonar type thing and come standard on all new phones.
"Require a one hour class for purchases of new phones about safety using a phone - web or instructor-led. The class would include statistics related to safety and the phone, eg. accidents."
An alert system attached to the back of a phone that detects sudden movements.
"At crosswalks, an arm comes down and a bell sounds, as the pedestrian approaches, like at a railroad crossing. When the pedestrian puts the cell phone away to cross the street, the arm lifts."

The keyboard could type simple 1-2 digits while moving (or pre-determined key groupings such as 9-1-1 or selection of a contact).
"A sensor on the phone that would alert the person when they were approaching something they could run into, like a tree, pole, etc."

An app that beeps a warning when it detect the phone is in motion while in use.
"My solution is software-based. Using the map/location feature of the phone, the phone will be able to ""know"" when the user is texting and walking (b/c the location is slowly changing). In this situation, the text feature will pause for a few seconds and force the user to look up at his/her surroundings. (Note that this will not work when the speed is faster - which will allow a passenger to text in a moving automobile.)"
"The idea would be shoes which connect to your phone wirelessly. With the swaying motions of walking, the phone would alert the shoes and increase resistant if texting also occurred."

Install cameras at busy crosswalks that use computer recognition technology to spot people who have their heads down looking at their phones. There are speakers that verbalize warnings for people to look up. There should also be a system where fines can result occasionally but randomly.

"An app that syncs with a pedometer which locks your phone when you are in motion unless it is an emergency, forcing the user to be unable to use their phone while walking/moving (cars/driving would be an issue, though). This would be ideal for parents to install on a child's phone or their own to force themselves to not use their own phone while in motion."
"Make an app that recognizes when a cell phone is moving on a gps map and and shut off the screen automatically. The only way to get the screen to turn back on would be to stop moving. Arm motion wouldn't activate it because the gps would show it as stationary within 2 feet or so, but any walking, or even driving, would shut off the screen."

Motion sensory phone using a pedometer meter to count steps and automatically shut down any texting abilities.
"This is actually very relevant to current events with the latest gaming app PokemonGo. I think that since you cannot stop people from looking at their phones, and texting and walking, you would need to create a sensor or camera device, similar to the automated braking system in a vehicle. The sensor would instantly freeze up or flash a stop sign (for lack of better words), cautioning the user of the impending accident."

Along with the clear view is a second screen inside the glasses that could show you the text but better: includes an earplug/speaker and a microphone so you can hear the text read to you (in the senders voice) and reply by speaking your message (or better: pupil correlation to an inside lens sensor that perceives your pick of keywords/phrases).
