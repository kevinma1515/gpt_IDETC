"It would have to be a cup with an electronic sensor in it. The measuring cup settings would have braille on them, so the blind person could select how much they want. Then the actual cup would have an electronic sensor that either vibrates or makes a noise signaling the blind person that it is enough in the cup."
A talking measuring cup.
"The measuring cup has a scale built into it, which talks to the person, hears your response, and talks you thru the measuring. You can set it for liquids or powders, and tell it the amount you are needing. It will tell you to start pouring slower, then when you have reached the correct amount."
"""Sous Chef"" measuring cups come in sizes from 1 to 4 cups.  Each ""Sous Chef"" is coated with a slight padding of silicon.The silicon provides an easier, more secure grip.  More important, the silicon protects the sensors that are embedded between the coating and the cup's outer surface.""Sous Chef"" is partially voice activated.  The cook says ""ON,"" then ""wet"" or ""dry"" to activate the weight-sensor on the bottom of the cup.  This ensures proper measurement of liquid and dry ingredients.  As the cook pours an ingredient into the cup, a chime (or optional voice) will sound for each unit of measurement."
"The measuring cup has a small microchip that detects light passing through the cup so it is able to tell how full the cup is. The device also has a small speaker that allows it to announce how full the cup is. It can also have voice activated commands that allow it to say ""stop"" when a preset amount of stuff is reached in the measuring cup."
"A measuring cup that when filled, braille is pushed out by what is inside the cup. Like the pressure of the objects inside pressing on the inside would cause little bumps to be pushed outward and the blind person would be able to run their finger along the edges and be like ""Yeah, that is the braille for 1/4 cup""."
I am thinking of a measuring cup that looks like a coffee mug. It has a handle. Inside of it is a heat activated by a human finger that tells you what the measure is. For example 1 cup would say one cup and then it would help a blind person feel the heat then the voice.
"A plastic cup with a lid with raised graduations on the side , so that the person can feel the temperature change as the liquid passes the graduation"
machine that will dispense amount of fluid based upon voice command
Have a clay cup that had deep marks in it with lines and numbers so the blind person knows exactly what measurement they are at.
A cup that has braille on the sides of it.   The braille will be the numbers and words for measuring.
A cup that has ridges that pop out when material reaches that level the person can feel
A measuring cup fitted with a device attached to the base that indicates cup measurements with corresponding beeps or verbal announcements.
"A single electronic measure cup that when you pour powder or liquids into it and they settle on the bottom, a light sensor goes off at various heights in the cup and plays a chromatic scale to indicate the amount filled."
"It's a normal measuring cup but with Braille on the outside and inside of the glass/plastic that a blind person can feel to know how much they filled, being able to touch the substance inside while measuring with their hand with the help of the Braille."
"I measuring cup with raised markings on the outside of the cup that can be felt with fingers to denote the different levels of measurement (ie. 1/4 cup, 1/2 cup....etc)"
"This would have lines, like a regular measuring cup, but the lines would be raised so they could be felt by the blind person. The markings would be in braille."
"the cup would come with a weight scale. The user would press a button on the scale to select, by voice command, what substance they plan to measure. Once selected, they would set the cup onto the scale and proceed to pour the liquid or matter into the cup. The scale would sound out how much is in the cup based on its weight. ie- the scale would say ""1 cup"" once you poured 8 ouches of water into the cup."
A cup that can tell you when your liquid is up to a certain point.
A measuring cup that has large brail on the top so the blind know what size the measuring cup is. The measuring cup would be a little larger than usual and would beep once you got to the selected size.
The cup would have braille all over to tell the blind person the measurements. It would also be a spill proof cup.
"A normal measuring cup but with Braille on the handle indicating the amount. Also, there's a cap over the ""bowl"" of the cup, which they can lift up, to ensure that they can capture the right amount without worrying about spilling"
"A cup that has bumps that appear on the outside but only as it fills, sort of like the pin art toys."
a cup with high ridges which feel a different temperature when the contents inside reach different levels.
Talking measuring cup. Provides audio feedback of amounts contained in the measuring cup using both weights and volumes.
The measuring cup will have Braille on the handle so they know what size they are currently using. It can have a slider on the top of the cup that they can slide across the ingredient after they scoop it in. This will knock off excess ingredient.
braille on the rim for each measuring cup.
a coarse outer liner that allows it to be identified through touch
An ordinary measuring cup with an electronic voice that alerts the user when a certain amount has been reached.
Cup measures blind
"Liquid measuring cup with braille directions on the inside of the cup. This allows the blind person to put their finger into the side of the cup, see where the measures are, and feel when the liquid is filled to whichever measure is desired."
A cup that beeps or clicks when certain levels are passed
A cup with holes you plug along the side.  Each plug you put in allows the glass to fill up one tenth of a cup more and you fill it up and let the excess leak out
A cup with clearly raised measuring lines and braille numbers. Maybe there would be some sort of sound or rumble based feedback depending on how much liquid/solid is inside the cup.
This cup would be spill proof and vibrate when filled
"The cup will have sensors and a speaker, so that as the liquid level reaches each increment (1/8 cup, 1/4 cup, etc.), a voice speaks out the quantity. You should be able to choose from a variety of voices, like well known chefs (Gordon Ramsey, Paula Dean, etc.)."
"the cup has a sensor around it at different levels to indicate half, fourth, eighth cup. a beep sounds each time the cup is filled past each level, so user can count beeps"
"A cup could have a digital gauge to tell where the liquid is. The cup then has infrared lights, OR, small lines that raise at the liquid level. You could have something that water repels at each level and then when there is no water there is no repel therefore showing the blind person the level. I would assume this would be at ounce levels."
A cup that widens a lot for each measurment and is like a stack of cups into one cup.  There would be holes in the cup that when filled at each measurement would make a whistling sound from air forced out.
something with levels that can be measured by touch
It would be a set of nesting bowls with a unique shape like a wave around the rim of the bowls.  The inside would have raised markers with braille measurement marks and there would be a main measurement mark in braille on the outside.  I think a unique shape would be a decorative detail that would appeal to someone relying on their tactile senses and it would help them find the bowls in the cupboard.
"This cup would be made of plastic, so that if it is ever dropped it would not break and hurt someone. It would have Braille measurements on the outside. It would have a plastic lever on the inside that moved down to whatever Braille measurement was pressed on the outside, and when the amount reached the lever it would beep to indicate it was full to that measurement."
"A plastic cup with sensors along the side of the cup, from bottom to top that detect the presence of water. An imbedded microchip will read the output of the sensors and (upon the push of a button) announce the level to which the water has come in the cup."
It is glass like a regular measuring cup but the measurements are in braille. This is so the blind can feel the measurements to make sure they are correct even though they cannot see. Another idea just popped up...a measuring cup with a gauge in it that triggers a voice letting the blind person know they just filled 2 cups.
it reads aloud as filled to key thresholds
"The side of the cup has small, individual pins about the gauge of the pins in ""pin art sculpture"" desk toys, and very short. The cup would be metal, as well as the pins. The inside is lined with a thin layer of rubber, and the very short pins are are attached to the rubber, through the ""shell"" of the measuring cup in individual holes based on the measurement increments. When the cup is empty, all of the pins would be slightly recessed, so there's no mistake, and the slightest pressure from contents would push the pins slightly out of the shell at the level of the contents."
A cup that's designed to play different acoustic pitches when it reaches certain levels.
braille cup
An electronic cup with a water proof light sensor that as the blind person filled the cup it would beep starting at 1/4 cup.
A simple measuring cup but it comes with a small scale with an electronic voice. When measuring simply place the cup on the scale and start pouring the liquid. The scale will announce as it reaches certain milestones.
"A voice activated robotic system set in-tune with the person's voice.Using a braille keyboard, the person types in their needs to a computer that performs the collecting & measuring for them.Preprogramming meals for the blind person ahead of time and on schedule."
"Braille would be used to communicate the measurements rather than letters/numbers. It would have a sensor and while the consumer would have their thumb on the measurement they would like on the outside of the cup, the sensor would subtly ""beep"" when the filling of the substance meets with the level of the consumer's thumb inside of the cup."
A cup that hears you tell it how much you want and then it tells you when you have that much in it.
the cup would have to have built in sensors to read the person's hand. it would also need a voice sensor to recognize speech commands. could be a cup or a large cup-like device.
measuring cup with a braille handle that reads the measuring size.
"a plastic measuring cup that gives in braille the cup amount (1 cup, 1/2 cup, etc.) on the handle. On the inside there are braille marking denoting how high the liquid/solid is in the cup."
"While there is braille, I think a cup with raised marks to indicate each different fluid level that could be pressed in so it  separated out amounts of substance would work somewhat well."
"It is electronic-based, and basically has a voice telling you how much you're pouring as you are pouring. So when you hear it say ""1 cup"" then you know you have one cup, and so on. It has sensors to know how much you've poured into the measuring cup."
"MeasureAble is the new measuring cup that tells you through audio feedback how much liquid you are adding to a measuring cup.  Great for the blind or hard-of-seeing.  As you pour liquid slowly, the cup will let you know vocally when you've added 1/8, 1/4, 1/2 and so on until a full cup.  If you add to much, just pour some out and let the cup level.  It will tell you how much is there now, and simply add until you've reached the amount you want.  With pleasant male or female voice."
"In keeping with existing accommodations like braille, raised indicators, voice prompts, a measuring cup could have both braille on the outside (so people could read the various measurements)...and a motion-activated sensor that announces ""You have one-half cup."""
"It would be a measuring cup that audibly alerts the user to the amount of material that is present within the cup. It would alert in incriments of eighths, quarters, thirds and wholes."
a movable lever that changes the size of the compartment.  The indents would be written in braille.
"the measuring cup would be slightly larger than one cup and would have embossed on the inside of the cup the levels for 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3 cup increments noted in braille.   the levels would be embossed around the inside of the cup as well as the measurements. in this way, the blind user could pour liquid into the cup and feel the proper level and would stop filling the cup at that level."
The cup would have a braille keypad on the side to which the person could select the desired amount to be measured. Then once the contents reach the entered amount the cup would either vibrate or beep to alert the user that they have filled the cup to the correct measurement.
a simple measuring cup with brail on the inside so they could feel the level of the contents and the corresponding brail level.
Braille words on the different measuring cup sizes
"the cup would have some sort of weighing device built into it and would be voice controlled. the blind person would say ""i need 2 cups of chocolate chips"" and the cup would confirm the command. Then they would start slowly pouring it into the cup and sounds would indicate when they are getting close to the amount, and when they are at the amount, and if they have too much in the cup."
a cup that has pronounced bumps at specific points
"Create the cup with a light sensor that beeps at increments of 1/4 a cup. For example 1 beep for 1/4 cup, 2 for 1/2, etc. On the handle would be a switch allowing the user to choose increments in 4ths or 3rds."
one with sound milk goes in has t push a ball up or something or makes a whistle . possibly a whole new branchof sounds to become acquainted with this product
A touch sensitive cup that can inform those seeing impaired or blind specific measurements needed when cooking or other needs.
"Instead of simply flat lines and numbers, this cup would include indents with braille numbers next to them. These indents and braille numbers would instantly vibrate (like a phone) whenever a liquid goes near them, allowing the blind person to always know exactly where the water is in the cup. (This would only work for precise measurements, though.)"
"A measuring cup that has braille on the handle and makes a beeping, or chirping sound, as the cup is filled to the correct level."
"A cup with a funnel shape on the end of it. It starts to vibrate as you get close to full, and beeps when it is completely full."
"A measuring cup for the blind would consist of a durable glass cup, that is covered in silicone to prevent burns. On both sides of the cup the measurements would be clearly listed in braille, for ease of measuring. There could also be some sort of vented lid, to prevent burns, if the person using it, were to stumble or to fall."
A measuring cup that has pieces that stick out once a certain amount has been reached and also shakes
"An automated machine based on braille coded buttons that automatically measures common cooking items in a automated process.  Sugar,flour, and others would simply be loaded into the machine regularly to keep the machine useful."
a cup with a float that is shaped to hang outside the cup and touch the table when empty.  the float raises up and the blind can measure by feeling the height of the float.  It could have braille on the outside of the cup that lines up with the float and is easy to feel.
The person would pour what they want into a cup.  They will keep another cup with markings on top of the other cup.  It will be like one cup placed over the another.  The top cup will have markings which the user can feel and adjust the amount in the bottom cup based on the readings from the cup on the top.  This dual cup technique should solve the problem for the blind.
It is a basic measuring cup only it has it's size written in Braille on the handle.
"It would look like a regular measuring cup, but once the substance inside reaches each level, a bump would be activated on the outside of the cup.  So, if liquid reaches .25 cup, a small bump would activate on the outside of the cup that the person would be able to feel."
"It would be a measuring cup with sensors at the top or near the top so that when it is full, the cup makes a dinging sound. There could also be a measuring cup with bumpy ridges in it so that the blind person can feel for the levels."
"I am picturing a machine similar to a coffee maker or food processor, however, it is voice activated like Alexa. You can pour whatever liquid or oats you need to measure our through the top. Next you'll command it to measure , ""Machine, measure out 1 cup."" The machine will then measure out a cup. If there is not enough liquid/substance to satisfy your measurement, it will let you know to add more, and you may tell it to continue when you are ready."
"It would have to be accessible. It would need to be easy for the blind to pour into. If dry ingredients were measured, it would need self leveling. If wet it would read out how much liquid is being added as you poured and would blare a sound when you have enough. Before any measuring is done, a voice command would be used to tell the cup the target measurement."
"A large container with holes knocked along the side.  On the handle buttons can be pressed according to their braill markings. When one is pressed,  that unique hole is opened allowing it to drain to that level."
"Although a tactile experience might be more desirable for cooking in noisy environments or with guests, I think that an audio notification would be easier to implement. The cup would have a series of sensors running vertically, such that it could detect both the height of the liquid or solid contained at different points along the edge of the cup. This would allow for the cup to sense sloshing liquids or unevenly distributed solids. A button on the handle would start the measurement process, and the cup would then report the results in the user's desired format."
A digital measuring cup that speaks to the user and reports how much liquid is in the cup.
"A digital interactive measuring cup. Measuring cup that tells you when to stop at certain measures.Easy cleaning with warm wet cloth. Water proof."
a measuring cup that beeps when it gets full
"A series of measuring cups, actually. These have braille on the handles to let the user know which size is which."
I would take a regular measuring cup and put braille on each measurement.
A measuring cup with a sensor attached to the side that senses when the object being measured reaches each line and would make a different sound for each measurement or could have a voice say that measurement that has been reached.
A cup that uses voice and sound to let a person know when the desired measurement has been reached.  You tell the cup how much you need and it will beep when you can close and buzz when you hit the desired Measurement.
"There will be a deep cup, and a easily identifiable handle in which there will be a button.  When you hit the button, it will ask the user what needs to be measured (fluid or solid) and then ask the user how what measurement they would like.  The measuring cup will then alert the user as they are drawing closer to the specified measurement and will stop them when it is done."
"maybe a cup with raised lines on the outside and inside, along with braille to correspond with each measurement"
a cup that is slightly larger than what it needs to be that makes a sound when it is at the right measurment
"automated voice, braille numbers, programmable measurements, option for metric system, light weight, able sighted friendly, respond to commands"
I am thinking of a Braille measuring cup.
"Braille on the side of the handle that tells the measurmentA small lever on the side of the cup that rises when liquids are added to it, that way they can feel when it is full"
"It would have to be tactile. For a liquid measuring cup i supposed the lines would have to be raised and labeled in braille. For dry measuring cups I would think of a set that is kept in a particular order, graduated, so the user would know the one on the left was 1 cup, then 1/2 cup and so on."
