a extension pole with a claw at the end of it.
"A grabber sort of tool, but with much more precise control and thinner/stronger arms than I've seen. Would be like an extended arm. I'm imagining a sort of two pronged fork on the end of it and from the other end where you hold, you can widen/narrow the gap between the prongs. The arms would be very thin so you could for example slide them into the narrow gap between books on a shelf. Once you adjusted the grip properly, just pull it out."
"A long handled device with a hook at then end of it so that people an reach for the book and slide it off its resting place.Adjacent to the hook is a basket which catches the book so that the book doesn't fall down to the floor or hit anyone."
"There are currently long sticks with a gripper on the end that people use to reach something high on a shelf.  Because of this device I decided to amend it for reaching a book.  Books can be quite heavy and I do not think people would trust the current gripper.  Mine would be made with a canvas basket near the top.  Instead of a gripper it would just have a small hook that could be used to reach the desired book.  Then, instead of holding a gripper and hoping the book doesnâ€™t fall down on me, I would just place the hook on the top of the book.  As I pull it forward it would fall into the canvas and I could slowly pull basket down. The stick would have an attachment like a fishing rod and this would allow me to reel in the book."

It would also have a clamp at the end to pick up the book, and a sort of ""pistol grip"" lever to tighten the clamp around the book."
"The idea is a long, telescopic stick with a clamp on one end and a handle on the other end. When you squeeze the handle the clamp closes.
