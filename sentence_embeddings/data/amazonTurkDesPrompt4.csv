It would be a puffer kind of like a perfume bottle only the container would be on top instead of the bottom. You would pull a trigger and air would shoot the powder out.
Use the same container that weed killer comes in or bug spray and apply the powder there
"I thought of an automatic powdered sugar dispenser. It would be easier and less messy than a sifter. The device is small and easy to clean and store. All you have to do is pour the powder in at the top of the device and then press ""lite"" ""medium"" or ""heavy"" setting for how much sugar you want. After you press the button, hold over pastry in a circular motion to cover entire area. Then enjoy."

"In order to create a ""A device that disperses a light coating of a powdered substance over a surface,"" you will first need to understand magnetic charges. The device will give the surface a certain charge. This could be merely a handheld device that creates a static charge. The powdered substance will have the opposite charge. Once you open the powder up, the charges will stick together and there will be an even coating over the surface due to the attraction. Easy as pie. Feel free to pay me royalties for this as I am poor."
A refillable round-shaped machine that sprays out powder evenly like a mist.
"This device would be automatic.  The container would be on rollers and when turned out would move back and forth sending out a pre-measured dose out of its non clogging spray nozzle.  It would not be necessary to hold the container, there would be a gps grid set-up that would keep the spray contained within the area designated.  It would be robotic."
"A timed air bladder that is filled with the powdery substance.  The air bladder would be suspended over the surface and moving slowly.  As the timer wears on, the powdery substance leaks out onto the surface."

I would have a spray nozzle like a airbrush machine to evenly coat with air pressure.
"A kind of cloth that you can put over the surface, then spread the powdered substance on the cloth and use a dowel type object to spread the powder. The cloth would be designed so that it would only allow a specific amount of the powder to go through the cloth. Lift up the cloth, the powdered substance stays on the surface and the excess can be returned to the original container."
"There is a container of the powdered substance suspended over the surface on which to be applied. There are two layers of a rigid material on the underside of this container which contain small holes for the powdered substance to slowly fall from. When the device is not activated, one of the layers of rigid material is slid over such that the holes are not aligned, preventing the powdered substance from falling through. When activated, the holes are aligned, and a vibrater attached to the container causes the powdered substance to coat the surface that is underneath the device."

kind of like a rotating can on wheels
A handheld unit with a bag similar to what you would use for ice packs but more pliable and waterproof that could be changed out with a screw top to use different colors if needed.  The nozzle would need different pattern heads similar for different types of sprays.

The air brush lotion dispenser.  This device looks like a shower nozzle with a long extension to reach every part of your body.  It sprays a perfect coating of lotion on you using airbrush technology.
"I think of  product that looks similar to a mini-vacuum. However, this product is like a reverse vacuum. This is a product for baking. You load the chamber of the device with a substance like powdered sugar or cocoa powder. The device will cover the bake item with whatever powdered substance is in the chamber."
"Create a divice similar to a shower head, although much larger and shaped to fit the surface to be covered. The holes would be much smaller/finer than in a shower head and the amount of powder to be dispersed would be controlled so that it was put into the device in pre-determined quantities based on the project to be completed. As the powder is released,  air-controlled fans would very gently blow the powder onto the surface to keep the powder from dropping like rain onto pinpoint areas (making it more of a blanket effect)."

The powdered substance would be caught in a reservoir under or in front of the fan (operated at a low speed) to be held by hand (sort of like a hose sprayer, but in dry form) maybe with a lever to control the speed of the fan and dispersed amount."
"A cross between a CNC machine and a salt shaker. It moves in a predetermined route, dispersing it across wherever needed"
"Depending on the size of the surface, you could have a type of non-adhesive but static prone film that you would be held over the powder container, then charged so that a roughly constant layer of the power would cling to the film. Then the charged, powder covered film would be placed over the surface to be covered (or the powder container moved and replaced by the surface), and the film discharged, dropping the powder."
A plasma gun with a nozzle tuned to disperse a precise powdered coating.
"With it's laser-guided tracking and controlled dispersal output, this device can be used to ensure that you coat surfaces with powdered substances accurately every time.  Saves money by ensuring only the exact amount needed.  Guaranteed even distribution to within 1 micron.  Simply set the frame above the item you want to powder, and let ""PowderMatic"" do the rest.

a cannister that sprays and coats something of choice.
"A small canister with a spigot at the top and a plunger is used to spread powder over a surface.  The bottom of the canister is a rubber sheet that can be activated with a button.  When it is, the rubber sheet flicks the powder inside of the canister up, aerosolizing the small pieces.  The plunger blows a stream over the top of this cloud of aerosolized particles, causing them to come out of the spigot in a fine cloud, and settle over the surface."
A container with a perforated lid to dispense substance
A small salt-shaker like item. This one has a ball of air puffer like a perfume bottle. When squeezed it'll shoot out a small amount of the powdered substance.
"A cup/tube cover, with multiple layers that have holes on each layer but in different positions on each layer. The holes of the different cover that you can attach, also vary in size depending on what is being spread"
"I bake often at home and this prompt made me immediately think of the problem I have with powdered sugar. If I wanted a light coating of powdered sugar over a large danish, it is easier to use a shaker, but the sugar is not evenly and lightly distributed. A sifter is more ideal, but more messy and bulky. A product that came in between would do nicely, where the end of a tall and narrow shaker was more of a sifter. A sifter would be convex and there would be a screen and a sifter handle. The handle when maneuvered helps to aerate the powdered sugar, thus making the coating as light and even as possible. Maybe an additional lid for storage could be provided, where the sifter end is removed and a twist lid as a replacement."
"A device that can be used while cooking and baking where you put the powdered substance into one piece of the device, while the product you want coated is on the other. Connect the two together and hit start. The powdered substance would then be spread on the product even and accurately."
An automatic brush machine that could be adjusted to dispense a light to heavy coating of a powdered substance.
