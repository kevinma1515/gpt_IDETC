"Some sort of lift on the bottom, powered by a button or lever on a nearby wall (or post, if outside) could be helpful. Then, a short kid could lower the drinking-part down (as could someone in a wheelchair), and a taller person could raise it up to a comfortable height."
Push A button affixed to the wall of a building which raises and lowers the base of the fountain.
the fountain can have a stool that can be pulled out for children and people that are not tall enough to reach when they are at the fountain.
"Since public drinking fountains are already made, the way to make them more accessible would be to make them cheaper and easier to maintain. I would make the fountains like pop fountains. Plastic fountains, easier to take apart and easy to clean. With an internal cooling system and an internal cleaning system that cleans the inside parts by putting small amounts of chlorine in the water, which would then be filtered out before being dispensed."
"A nozzle that is adjustable to height, but still has a shield to protect it from people putting their mouth on it."
"Accessible for people of all ages indicates to me that it needs to be easy to use (mobility issues) and for people of different sizes (height). A drinking fountain that easily and quickly adjusts height with a button, foot pedal, or voice activation. Activation of the water stream could be voice or motion activated."
Have a lever attached to the side with a mechanism that will lower and raise the water fountain as needed.
we can put a pedal or handle to change the height of the fountain
"Instead of the traditional spout method of drinking fountains, we could change to a drip method. Basically instead of shooting the water up like drinking fountains now, change the fountains to shoot the water down, like a faucet. This would allow anyone to use the water fountain, and it would also open it up to be able to be used for water bottles."
Have the fountain be on a movable electric lift of some type that can be easily operated by a switch to move it up or down.
A device that hangs below the drinking fountain and pulls steps out for the child to step up.  It has to be easy enough for a child to be taught to use.
Using a retractable hose like the sprayer in a sink.
a construct that can move up and down and know how by a camera
Mount the drinking fountain on the wall so that it can be raised and lowered for each person by raising and lowering a lever or pushing a button.
make the drinking fountain with a sensor that detects the height of the use and then adjusts the height of the fountain to the users height so that they do not have to bend over or be lifted up to use it
A hose that comes out of the wall and is long and flexible enough to reach people of all heights
Have a long pole with spickets coming out at certain heights of the pole.  height levels of drinking
"If the main pipe feeding the water fountain was flexible, you could place a hydraulic lift within the water fountain that would allow the fountain to move up and down.  this could be activated by a peddle if no electricity was available or a button and motor if electricity were available."
"There can be a an adjustable nozzle on the drinking fountain with an extendable hose so that the drinking fountain can be adjusted to many heights as needed.  The apparatus could work similarly to a microphone stand, but perhaps with a clipping mechanism so that the nozzle can be adjusted quickly."
"Have the faucet part of it sliding, with a possible bending neck, similar to those in professional grade kitchens for the sinks. That way any height can reach it, but not have it so high or accessible that people could use it as a hose/weapon. It would also need a way to disinfect or clean itself, since younger people tend to be a bit more gratuitous with their germs."
"There should be fountains of all heights so children are able to reach the fountain as well as taller fountains for those people who are adults. Fountains should be located in stores, schools, parks, and other high-traffic public places."
Stairs that fold out similar to a church pew
I think a telescoping water fountain would work.  Maybe made of stainless steel so it wouldn't rust.  It could either be adjustable with a push button or on a push and pull system.  This would be a pedestal style fountain that even wheel chairs could use.
Include stairs on one side so everyone can reach
Shorten the drinking fountains or redesign the current standard. Height adjustable.
A button placed on the metal box of the water fountain that can raise it (out from the ground) or lower it (into the ground). It will stop at certain heights however that aren't feasible human heights
The drinking fountain would be tall and almost resemble a shower. The water would come out in a very thin stream though. The fountain would be activated by foot pedal. The person would have to turn their head sideways to drink out of the vertical stream which would empty into a drain on the ground. It would be like when a cat drinks out of the faucet. This would be better suited for outdoors.
"Built-in, retractable steps. In fotane pulling of a special lever, it is possible to put forward the steps that can use children."
fountain or faucet extends with press of a button to accommodate different heights
A water fountain that can move up and down based on the the height of the drinker. The fountain could be attached to a wall or pole and can be easily moved around to change the height.
"There could be a robotic water fountain.   When you walk up to the fountain, you press a button that controls what height you will need the fountain to be.   The fountain then adjust to your height with robotic control.  Then it can sprinkle a thin line of water at a height that is best for your size."
the drinking part is a nozzled hose that extends like hookah with disposable straw tips. The hose is accessible while sitting or standing and has a 5 foot length.
"The spout of the water fountain is the height of a tall person and the water arcs like normal except the basin of the fountain is at a child's height so that anyone can drink at any point in the water arc; however, the basin is also elongated to incorporate the wide water arc."
Having water fountain spouts that lower or raise.
"I considervthat public drinking fountains can be madevwith adjustable heights.  For instance, the push of a button could measure the height of the individual and sensors record the data and the fountain appropriately adjusts itself."
"An extendable nozzle could be used instead of the fixed water source, so users of any height could pull the water toward their mouth. Kids could pull it down to spray water over a drain, and taller adults could pull it up to their mouths. It should probably have some kind of mouth guard to ensure people don't come into direct contact with the water source."
"it could be adjustable in height and water pressure, so children can have it lower, adults taller, and for disabled or those who need more time, lower water pressure."
a motorized water fountain that moves up and down depending on you height
Have steps with a handrail that is mounted on s track thst can be pulled out from under the water fountain and locked in position.
"A drinking fountain that senses your height and then moves up and down according to users size, it can also move in and out by pushing a button on the side for those who are in wheel chairs.  The drinking fountain would be very minimal, just the fountain, a bowl, and one pipe for the drain.  This object could be inside or outside."
"Think of a computer chair. Computer chairs tend to always have the lever underneath the seat that you can pump either up or down to make the seat of the chair go up higher for someone with longer legs, or down lower for someone who is shorter in height."
"A flexible hose encased with steel braiding that can be pulled from faucet by people either too short of tall, or wheelchair bound to get a drink that would retract after use. Could also be used to fill water bottles or portable dog bowls for additional access."
"The drinking fountain can be adjustable, both vertically and horizontally.  This would make it easy to lower it for kids.  And it could easily raise so it could be comfortable for adults or people that have trouble bending.  And it can move horizontally to help people in wheelchairs."
"A pole that has a lever on in that you can release and slowly raise or lower the entire fountain, or just the drinking part."
A height adjuster
A metal spigot that digs into the ground or can be connected to existing water sources wherever you are (sort of like a spicket you plug into a tree for syrup)
A drinking fountain that is able to slide up and down at the press of a button in order to accommodate people of all ages and heights.
"Each fountain has four places to drink, you hold your foot on the pedal and the longer you hold it the higher the water goes. When the water comes out where you want you let go of the pedal.  The water runs for ten seconds and then stops, then you do it again."
"Have a water fountain that has a button that will raise or lower it's height so that it can be the perfect height for anyone of any age.  Then have a spigot that pulls out something like a hose so that people can pull it out in case they still can't reach it  or just to make it more flexible.  If the fountain can't move up and down, it could be a platform that you step on, enter your height, and it automatically adjusts."
A waterfall style fountain setup would allow all heights of people to enjoy. Four seems to be a good number and the last two could be accessible to wheelchairs and smaller children. A j shaped curve or spout might help as well with the shape of the water rising and then falling for multiple spots on the stream to drink from. This would make it more comfortable. The water from the top would shoot to the pool of the second and so on. Therefore the stream is more accessible and is still caught.
A podium that extends up or down through the use of a simple button to make the fountain raise or lower.
A drinking fountain that has the sink adjustable in height.
"A Foundation that automatically adjusts to the height and the motion ability of the person who uses it, a person steps on the plate and the sensor scans the person and adjusts perfectly for comfort and accessibility."
"The fountain would have a level that you press for the fountain to go up or down depending on height of the person. If you are younger, it will go down, if you are older it will go up."
I think public drinking fountains could have a lift built into them to be raised or lowered based on the current user.
Use a flexible hose with a spout on the end.  Kind of like the lights on a flexible arm so you can direct the light where you want it but in this case it is the water.
pull out step from below fountains
simple lifting and lowering mechanism on the side of the fountain that will lift the entire fountain up or down so that it can accommodate any height.
"There would be something like a step stool, however it would work like an elevator that can raise and lower based on the users height automatically."
"A drinking fountain can be made to be adjustable.  The fountain would be lower for smaller people and handicap accessible, but able to rise to accommodate taller people."
"Create a multi-spout drinking fountain. Build it so that there are a minimum of 4 tiers, one for little ones, one for short people, one for tall people, and one for average height people. By constructing it in such a manner, it will allow for every person of any age to use it. You could also include a disposable drinking straw dispenser for each tier for those who either have issues with drinking from a regular fountain or those who have a phobia of germs."
"A mechanism on the side of the fountain that raises/lowers itPush down on the lever to lower the whole fountainPull up on the lever to raise the fountainwheelchair accessiblemore convenient for taller individuals"
the device would actually not be able to determine age. the determination would really be height. there could be a motorized pulley system with a sensor. the person could approach the fountain and the fountain would automatically adjust to the height of the person that wants a drink. there would have to be high quality detection sensors to prevent the fountain from being activated by small animals or critters
"Have the base of the dish attached to a crane type mechanism. Sort of like a destists lamp. Where it can be moved up or down, however the spout is not touched."
"A water fountain that can be adjusted with a lever, button, or handle, so it can be raised or lowered to the correct height of the user."
A mechanical pressure switch/elevator system that will raise a stool or stone block up from the ground when stepped on.
A stair stool with a ramp on both sides - for kids to walk up no matter their height and for wheelchairs to also go up if needed.
"I assume all ages means all heights, so perhaps one that has a lever for your foot.  You can step on the lever to raise or lower the fountain to the correct height for the person using it."
"A series of vertical buttons beside the system can be pressed to indicate where the spout and bowl needs to be for the user. It will then automatically raise. A manual variant can also be used with a joystick mounted on the side of the wall that can raise or lower the components. Internally, the drinking fountain will need to use a hose rather than a pipe so that it can freely move up and down on a track. I'm visualizing the bulk of the drinking fountain within the wall so that it is very unobtrusive. The sink could also fold up to conceal the spout when no in use, but have a sign above it to indicate that it is a public drinking fountain station."
"The drinking fountain's plumbing uses flex pipe. The drinking fountain can therefore be raised and lowered based on button options on a wall, the fountain itself (lower portion of the fountain), or stable pole adjacent with the fountain. The button options are pictured on the buttons and correspond with a person's likely height. For example, there will be a series of buttons with pictures, one depicting a toddler, a young child, an older child/adolescent, a teen, an average adult, and an especially tall adult. You press the button that most closely corresponds with your height. If you were wrong with your selection, you press the next most likely choice."
"The fountain lift.  When someone goes up to the water fountain, there is an easy to reach button to press that will either lift the fountain to the appropriate height, or lower it to where you are."
"A nozzle that attaches to the side of the drinking fountain, like a hose, for toddlers/small kids."
Moveable water bubbler. Press a button on the side to raise/lower the bubbler so people of all heights/ages could reach and not have to bend over so much. Could be electronic like the seat adjusters in newer vehicles. Could be mechanical like raising/lowering a moat
"A pedal to alter the height of drinking fountains, along with alterations to adjust the flow of the water from the spigot."
"A machine that resembles a coffee machine used for dispensing coffee for sale where there is an open space and a rack you put the cup on and the coffee comes out. Only for the water fountain, the machine would have a much larger square so heads could comfortably fit in. Instead of the water coming out of the top. it would have a slide lever on the side where you could slide the spigot up or down  to adjust it for different people's height."
The fountain would be a rectangle shape with several steps on the left side for young children to use.  The spout would shoot the water out to the left and right.
a pneumatic lift or stepstool
Add a step stool connected to the root of the water fountain. This way smaller people can have easier access to the fountain. Also add a motion sensor to turn on and off the water
fountains with adjustable heights
An water stream that can be adjusted by floor pedals for different heights.
Create a drinking fountain that is easy to adjust to height. whether that be through use of hydraulics so that a child could easily adjust the height without straining themselves. Have a foot pedal that you have to press to adjust the height.
"a bendable straw that could be positioned straight up in the air for adults, or bend and reach down toward the ground for small kids."
an adjustable drinking fountain
"Have a sensing panel, where the person touches the panel and a moveable dispenser would adjust to that height. If the person needed it lower or higher, the would move their hands.  There would be a sensor to not move if the person is drinking so they wouldn't get clobbered by the moving piece."
A pull out step that pulls or swings out from the base of fountains.
"The drinking fountain would be automatic in that if you put your head in front of it, the water would start automatically,  and would be placed quite high up, but if you step on the platform in front of it, it would raise to the height such that everyone would be tall enough to reach it. There would have to be ways to keep people safe on said platform, like some barriers to keep the space enclosed."
Automatic drinking fountains that lower and raise at the touch of a button.
Putting steps along the side that makes it easier for younger children to reach it but not get in the way of older adults.
"I was picturing a long hose that can rest on a holder so it never touches the ground and gets dirty. Some faucets are made to be ""stretchable"" and mobile, so why not water fountains? Shorter people, including children, can pull the hose down and aim the spigot at their mouth."
"I would use a manual pullable drinking spout like the detachable shower heads that are in showers.  That way anyone could pull it to wherever they are, like in a wheelchair, and drink from it."
A drinking fountain that can raise and lower.
A public drinking fountain on a barber chair-like device that swivels and moves up and down for all sizes!
You could have an attachment that would fit onto the water spout. It would be a flexible tube that you could use to easily drink from the fountain. It would use magnets to stick to the fountain.
a rising booster stool that allows a person of any height to be able to reach for water.
My idea is a water fountain that has more than one spout - one high and one low. The method for turning on the faucet is a handle which is very simple to turn. There is a step with two different stairs on the side so that shorter people can climb up to use it. The water fountain is set on the wall higher than most fountains so that older people can use it easily but the stairs allow younger people to climb up to it.
Auto-adjustable water fountain.
a motorized lift which raises and lowers the drinking fountains to reach people at different heights.
"The device is a like a fixed stationary step stool but of 2 different heights on 2 sides of a public drinking fountain. The third side does not need to exist because it is simply the ground for adults of normal height. The 2 different heights will accommodate different heights of children, who will be able to step up to the fountain. The device can be adjustable at the time of installation."
A drinking fountain with different steps around the sides so all sizes are able to access the water.
"Utilizing a typical drinking fountain cooling tank, add varying levels of collection ""bowls"" along the sides to accommodate users of different heights to hold a removable spout over the bowl. For the spout, it would be similar to the kitchen sink faucets that allow the spout to be pulled from the holder then retracts back into the faucet."
