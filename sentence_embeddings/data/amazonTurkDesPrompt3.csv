Meditation training audio tracking breath work in seconds - focus on breath and memorize internal timing of time passed.
"A piece of jewelry that changes color with time.  It could start of light at the start of an hour and get darker as time passes then start over at the new hour.  It could signify change in AM to PM with a light or glowing gem.  Hours could be displayed by different colors, i.e 1:00 could be red, 2:00 could be orange, etc."
"A new take on a sundial could be interesting. Perhaps something that's not super-high-tech, but simply uses signs from outdoors to communicate the information.

The device (wearable, probably) could ""read"" the sun's position and display the time in numbers or in a dial that echoes the sun's position."
"Have something in a vacuum that falls at a certain rate from an exact height drop repeatedly, so you know the exact timing of each drop."
An app that tells the time based on the precise tracking of stars from a telescope
"With the advent of fitness and health tracking personal devices- the device measures an average of your biometrics and then uses these averages to determine how much time has passed relative to you for a period of time- essentially telling you both how much you have aged and how much time has passed, and how the two relate to each other."
an app that captures a photo of what you were doing at specific intervals
"An app that plays different songs depending on how much time you need to measure. One song could be for 2 minutes, another song plays for 5 minutes, etc. Or you could set the app for a specific amount of time and the song would play for that amount of time, then stop."
A measuring of events over the passage of time. Thinking of major world events as pivotal moments in time as a way to measure the length of a period of time (if that makes sense).

A device that triangulates signals from distant pulsars to measure time by variations in distance.
This device would be a modernized hourglass of sand. It has a base which records the time in minutes when the sand passes through the middle part and it counts it.
"This is an idea for a bracelet.  It has clear beads, but the beads have LED lights.  You can turn it on just for color, or you should be able to turn a bead to set a timer."
"Kind of like an hourlgass, but instead of sand shifting, it would be filled with some sort of material that decays with time consistently. If you knew 50grams of the substance decayed or changed states in 60 minutes, you'd know how much time has passed by looking into the container."

A countdown clock that connects to your fridge or freezer so you know how long it's been since you opened it last
"You could use a device that studies the clouds.   Based on the thickness, our parents and visibility of the clouds, the time could be told.   You must trap air from outside into a full glass box.   From then, the device will be able to tell what time of day it is."
time could be measured with a digital hour glass that could be set to any amount of minutes and programmed so that the final drop of sand falls at the end of the timer.
"For people this could be like a biological clock. Someone might be 25 but they have aged like someone that is 40. For example think of a chemistry reaction. There is a start and finish of each reaction and you can measure different points. The only issue here is if it were measured as a percent of lifespan, there are many factors that could lead to anti aging for example a better diet or exercise. But, measuring time as a relative percent of the reaction might be something to look at. Temperature and environment would be good to think about as well in relation to reaction time."
"In a tall building have the hours written on the floor. Then hang a pendulum from the ceiling. As the earth rotates the pendulum will chart along the numbers on the floor to signify what time of day it is based on the rotation of the earth. In order to find the day, all that needs to be done is have large enough windows so that the shadows can show the position of the sun."
"Use a live organism, such as bacteria, that is known to multiply at a given rate under certain conditions.  Isolate that organism in the controlled environment and measure the increase in population."

"A clock with a customizable number of hours - for example, 30 instead of 24."
A camera that watches your pet's food bowl- when it's empty that means one day has passed. It records the patterns over a span of about a month and can calculate more exact measures of time from that.
A new way to measure the passage of time would be quantum time reader. It would use the atoms themselves to discern the exact passing of what we decide a second of time would be. It would be more accurate then a tradition clock and be evermore useful in fields that require such precision in timing. It would account for environmental interference in it's time keeping to provide the realist sense of the time available.
a device that measures the amount of sunlight and automatically calculates the exact date and time based on the amount of light.

"Something that literally gathers the light and a type of scale moves based on the light gathered changing the time displayed, like a mercury thermometer but it is moved by the sun light, artificial light would not change the time"
use a lamp that turns bright and shade over the minutes and by hours it turns a different color.
"This system of time based on the rotation of the moon instead of the earth/sun. One month is a lunar phase, one year is 12 lunar phases, and each day is based on the moons rotation."
"this would be a device that could be worn or put outside. the device would have sensors to measure temperature, climate, etc. it might be equipped with solar panels that would be able to record when the sun is out. also, it would have a computer chip to record changes. actually, I am thinking that the packaging would be such that once the package is opened, the process of recording time would begin. the device would not be exposed to the elements until removed from its packaging."
A new way to measure time would be to base time on how long it would take to completely burn a 3 foot long log. Every log would equal 2 hours.
An app that counts down from the year you think you will die.
"a Marble fountain, a fountain that has a time table on the side of a tube, something that is elegant and can be read per hour and by day, each marble per hour would be a certain color, while another marble would represent increments of 15 minutes. When the marbles fill up the tube every 24 hours, a calendar can be marked automatically and the marbles would be directed back in place to start the whole process over. The fountain would hold the used marbles at the bottom and methodically put them into place (internal workings of the fountain) before starting over again."
An Apple Watch app that measures your heartbeats and tells you your personalized time based on the number of heartbeats. Heartbeats average out similar on weekdays when the routing is pretty similar.
"Something that allows you to choose the length of time something you easily relate to takes and everything else is measured in terms of that event.  For example, if it takes 10 minutes to walk to the store, you could measure the time to work in terms of how many walks to the store it takes."
a laser which tracks the position of the rotation of earth by comparing it to the position of stars throughout the year.
The device would measure the breakdown of radioactive material and compare that to the know rate of radioactive decay.
"Similar to an hourglass instead of sand the content would be a liquid substance, whether it be water or something else."
"A time thermometer. A clock like device that counts down time, but looks much like a thermometer. It could be set to count down from as much as 24 hours or as little as 5 minutes. It would be wall mountable, display minutes and hours, but instead of circular it would be a straight vertical line going up to 24 hours. You would set what time you wanted it to count down from, and the filled in part of the line would start to decrease in exact keeping with the time. It could change color from green, to yellow, to red when time was running out. It could flash during and beep the last 5 minutes as a warning that time was almost up."
"Using the length of time to eating a certain food as a form of telling how much time has passed. Like eating an Apple, one can see what the average time of eating an apple is and use it as the idea behind a stop watch. You can see how many apples can be eaten within that time. It can be a digital interface as you can see the silhouette of an apple getting eaten and at the bottom you can see how many apples have been eaten entirely."
"A device that measures time based on blinks. First it would do a couple of trials by measuring your average amount a blinks within a given amount of time, and then after the trial, it would measure how many blinks you have done which would equal up to approximation a specific amount of time passed."
"Add time lapse features to Google street view and Google Earth so that we can go back in time (or forward perhaps using predictive software). It will be like the scene from HG Wells' ""The Time Machine"" when the shop window across the street displays the changing fashions. It will encourage us to think of time as more about the rate of change rather than a mechanistic tool of control."
"Taste, every day you replace an object that changes how it tastes according to the time of day."
"A ball rolling back and forth down a seesaw, each pass would be one second."
"""Timeline"" is a flexible strip of LED lights encased in soft plastic.  ""Timeline"" can be placed anywhere, in any position, even wrapped in a circle.  It looks pretty cool.  A remote timer controls the device.  Turn ""Timeline"" on, choose hours, minutes and/or seconds, and select a number.For example, choose ""Minutes"" and ""60.""  For each minute up to 30, a green light will appear on the strip.  From 31 - 49 minutes, each light will show up as yellow.  Lights for minutes from 50 to 60 will show up as red.  Optional chime will ring when the last minute is reached."
"Digital self-drawn laser clock art. The designs would be digitally drawn by a program either by a projection onto a flat surface, or pixels within the flat surface itself. The image would consist of a mandala or other pattern-based picture. The image altogether would take 24 hours to be completed, with each hour having minute sub-section images. Each of the minute sub-sections would also have second sub-sections. For example, the overall image could be a bouquet of flowers. Each flower would take an hour to be drawn, with each petal representing a certain amount of minutes that have passed by. This would be a mesmerizing live-art experience for those wishing to pass the time in a visually-stimulating way."
Use base 10 instead of base-6 numbers.
"A block you put in the freezer and it turns black. As it cools, it changes to the colors of the rainbow at equal intervals of time. So, based on what color it is, you can tell up to the nearest interval of time that has passed."
"We could divide time up into different color quadrants. There could be something like twelve colors, and depending on if it's a darker or lighter shade you would know if it were night or day. Then, your watch could just show the color of what time it is."
The sun app.  The sun app uses a satellite in space to tell time.  It will tell the time based on the amount of sun that shines on the satellite.  It has to be above the earth's atmosphere so clouds wont block the sun.
It would be the number of times my fan turned every time the sun raised and lowered.  This would be very difficult but also be very accurate
"A device that monitors the rotations and position of the earth, so that it can accurately determine where we are in space and monitor the changes in how fast we are moving, since time also changes with speed, and we determine what time it is by what position the earth is in and where is is relative to the sun."
"TIME IS INFINITE THEREFORE SOMETHING HAS TO BE ABLE TO EMBODY THAT, WHICH IS DIFFICULT SINCE THERE HAS BEEN SUNDIAL, SAND TIMER, AND CLOCKS INVENTED I BET THERE IS A WAY TO INCORPORATE MAGNETS SOMEHOW AND ALSO BE ABLE TO GET NOT ONLY HOW MUCH TIME HAS PASSED BUT IN WHICH DIRECTION YOU WENT IN DURING IT SO THE MAGNETS WOUD HAVE TO BE PLACED IN A COANTAINER WHERE THEY SLIGHTLY PUSH AWAY FROM EACH OTHER AT A SECOND OR MINUTES TIME TO COMPLETE A ROTATION"
