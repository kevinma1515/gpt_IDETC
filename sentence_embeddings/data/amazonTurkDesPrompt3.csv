A jump rope that is also to be used as a tie and or a belt during the day and while at work.
"A muscle stimulate band that can be worn over any area of the body that promotes muscle use, great for traveling and people who have to sit a lot."
"A simple, but strong band that has a hook to be able to attach to any (thin) pole or sturdy object. The band will have a handle on one side to do pulling exercises for lats, curls for biceps, chest flys for pecs, arm extentions for triceps, etc. It will be versatile and lightweight, and can be used almost anywhere."
"A calf strengthener, similar to a finger strengthener. It is placed on the floor of the car and pressed and released like a spring. More resistance could be added via a stiffer spring for a more difficult excercise."
A rubber ball that can be inflated / deflated extremely quickly.
"An x shaped resistance band that has 2 hand grips and 2 foot holds. The foothold will be stepped on to secure the system down, then the other two can be used for curls, rows, or presses depending on the position of the body. The bands can also be used for added resistance while doing push ups or sit ups."
"A mat that has electrosensitive pressure points on it, maybe to use as a guide for an exercise routine, to tell the person where the hand and or foot placement needs to be to accomplish the exercise. When unrolled a small device could attach to the mat itself and be used to program in the intensity or duration of the workout, and type of workout. When in use maybe the pressure points could light up to tell where the person needs to place feet or hands to do the workout, maybe as in a Yoga mat, with a yoga guide but the yoga guide is programmed into the small computer/device attached to the mat. It would have to be something that is waterproof and durable just in case it is stepped on, or something that the mat can ""remember"" after the device programs it to the mat, and then can be removed before the workout begins. The mat could be rolled up just like a Yoga mat - it would be a ""smart"" mat, capable of timing and capturing the persons movements, body weight, body mass, and calculate calories burned, and if the person is doing the yoga or whatever exercise the right way. Maybe a pilates mat too."
"A fold bike that could be used as a bike and also as an  device for exercise.  Mind wheels and all could fit in 48x48if you get it you will become  real rich person   good luck."
I think there should be a product that will help others who experience osteoporosis or other back issues to stretch while sitting. It will help them to feel more comfortable while traveling and can be taken anywhere. It can also serve a dual-function and be rolled up to make a travel pillow when it is not used for exercising. It would be similar to a soft mat but durable and flexible to serve its intended purpose.
I am thinking of a portable exercise device.
"A hydraulic cylinder with a clip and plate attchment, and band. Use the clip for pulling exercise, and the plate for pushing!"
"The best fitness equipment out there to get a quick, brutal workout in before heading out ... They are lightweight, super flexible and pack down easily in an already ... It can be used for a tonne of different exercises."
A weighted small object (5-20+ pounds) but very small (like a stone/brick/rock) so that it can be packed in a small space yet be able to be used to lift weights while away on travel/vacation.
"A foldable, carbon-fiber exercise bike."
A banding system integrated into a single holder
"This device would be a belly belt that is thin and lightweight and looks like a regular belt but is worn under clothes. It has small electrical impulses that occur periodically when you turn it on, reminding you to suck in your stomach to work out your abdomen muscles so you can use it while traveling, sitting, working, and anywhere you are with no one noticing."
"A device that looks like an accordion, and is operated by squeezing in and out could be used to exercise the arms. It offers resistance on both the pulling out and the pushing in motions. It can be locked into its pushed in position to be small enough to travel with."
"A Robotic carrying case that transforms into a step stool, a radio with speakers and a weight for lifting.   It also has a cupholder on top.   Wheels project from the bottom for easy carrying."
"Create a bladder type device that can be filled with water to create varying weight increments, then emptied and flattened for putting in the bottom of luggage, purse, etc. For the design, imagine a juice pouch shape put top to top (to make a double length juice box). The design should not allow water to flow through both bladders but each bladder should be filled individually.  This would allow the device to be used as a barbell with both sides filled, a medicine ball with only one side filled (there could be a velcro strap that allowed the unused side to be secured to the back of the filled side), an ankle/wrist weight when lightly filled, etc."
"Sets of exercise bands in different lengths and strengths. In a kit, with instructions on how to use the bands and which exercised to do with which band."

"yoga mat, jump rope, inflatable ball, wearable exercise recorder,"
"It is a lightweight yet sturdy bar with hooks on the end that clips back to itself to lock. While traveling, you will have some type of baggage, whether it be a suitcase, bag, large purse, etc. Being that the luggage will be full, it can be attached to the end of the bar one or both ends, locked into place to keep the bag from falling off, and used for various exercises."
"A bar that can be filled with water from a nearby source to increase its weight. Can be used for weightlifting, balance, etc."
"A pair of plastic barbells that can be filled with water in  hotel room and used to do a variety of exercises.  Depending on how much water is added, the weights would be lighter or heavier for use in different exercises.  Diagrams of the workout routine, which would take maybe 15 minutes, could be printed on the outside of the barbells and would be legible when water is added and they expand.  When empty, the barbells would weigh practically nothing and easy to pack."
"A small device that sends electrical pulses to your muscles, sort of like a massage therapy device, only amp it up a little to make it an exercise device."

"a adjustable strap or rope with 2 handles that can slung over a tree branch or anything else to do pullups and etc hook, hold, exercise,  travel, device,"
"This device would be a small resistance cord that is pulled out from a small wheel. The cord would be soft, yet taut, and rather long. The user can utilize this cord in the same way resistance bands are used."
"This is for those on a plane, bus, train, or in a passenger seat in a car. My idea is to have a box that has several springs coming out of it. At the end of each spring is a loop for hooking onto hand or foot. The person puts their hands or feet, or both into the loops and then pushes them in a way that makes the spring expand. Due to the tension in the spring, the user will get some exercise. The device is portable because all the springs go back in the center box when not being used or for carrying."
"A small rectangle that you place on the floor. It works like a treadmill, but much thinner. Less than an inch thick. It can roll out or fold up like a yoga mat. Works with a handheld device to control speed. Also shows calories, heart rate, and distance on this handheld device."
"folding rotating collapsible fan/wheel having a crank/handle for aerobic workout.  Blades provide resistance.  Perhaps changing number of blades (insert more/less) to change torque needed to crank.Rather like a bicycle wheel, with blades instead of spokes.  Cranked by hand."
"small foldable weight, suitcase, water bottle, liquid metal to lift, step stool"
It is like a hand grip where you push it and the push back helps build your muscles. It would be about the size of a beer can size and you hold it in front of your chest and push it together with both of your hands and then it pops back out.
"Light weights inside normal-looking shoes. When on a bus, train, or airplane, moving your legs about slightly would allow for exercise."

A lightweight hand exerciser that can be let go of or dropped easily.  It cannot involve your fingers inside anything.
A small treadmill.
"A portable chin up bar with resistance band attachments.  It would be portable because it would fold up, yet be made of strong enough material to be just as strong as chin up bars that install.  This way, people who frequently travel would be able to do weight lifting and resistance workouts more easily."
"It would be a small platform with a little set of pedals on it. It would weigh very little and it could even fold up. You would put it on the ground and then pedal it like a bike, so it could go anywhere you wanted it to."
"You usually need to be outside to use a jump rope.  This device would be a roller, about a foot in length run on a battery.  It would roll back and forth at an adjustable speed for a set distance and the person would jump over it for as long of a workout as they wanted. It would be aerobic instead of anaerobic, and you could use it for as long as you want, turn it off to take a break, and all you have to do is jump each time it came close to you.  You could also adjust how quickly it moved back and forth. The person could turn to jump over it each time, or they could learn to jump at prescribed times. They could also jump side to side for skiers, or one-footed, or alternate.  They could incorporate arm movements at the same time, or run it slowly and do burpees in time so that when they got up they would then have to jump and then do another burpee.  This could also be sold to prisons for inmate workouts. They could even step over it. Or buy two and have to step twice, turn, step twice, turn, etc.  This is actually a really good idea.  Hmmm."
The exercise device is a small resistance band that connects to your chin from your ears or headphones in order to do chin-ups. Chin-ups are an effective exercise that burns more calories than resting and reduces excess fat under the chin in the neck area. The chin-up strap itself reminds and motivates individuals to at least somewhat exercise whenever possible. The chin-up strap is lightweight and portable in pockets or bags.

"A piece of braided synthetic, stretchy fabric could be used for lots of exercises, and is easy to pack and store. The braiding would make it strong, and the stretch would make it flexible and versatile. It could be rolled up or spread out, stood on or pulled on, for various resistance training moves. It could also be closed in a door or drawer, or looped over a doorknob and pulled from there."
"A portable exercise device that can be used while traveling that is also discrete. I think of a lightweight weight of some sort that can change shape and form. Or, exercise bands."
"A pair sturdy (empty) balloons that you fill up from your hotel bathroom water tap that connect together with a strong, telescoping bar."
"I do not exeecise regularly.  When I was traveling on vacation recently, I did a lot of walking and noticed that my leg muscles were really stiff I had a bad case of  shin splint.  I tried to do some stretches in the morning before I started my day sightseeing but I couldn't even reach/grab my foot from behind to bend it up.  My suggestion for an exercise device that can be used while traveling is something I can use to hook/grab my foot from behind that I can use to pull/stretch my leg up toward my back."
A flexible board that provides resistance for different exercises
The device has two ankle straps connected on either side to a tube. The user straps the device to their ankles and springs in the tube provide resistance to them walking.
"A foot pump that sits on the floor with a button or pad for each foot. The button will only depress once enough force is used by the person's feet. A person can sit down, place their feet on the rest, and press their feet and legs up and down on the device. The force needed to depress the button is adjustable and can increase as a person gets stronger."

Allows the user to pull and, ideally, slowly release with their hands to strengthen and work the arm muscles. The mount can be flipped to adapt to either the right or left side. Small enough to pack in a carry-on bag, backpack, or even a purse."
"Supposedly people that ""bounce their legs"" have a higher metabolism and burn fat with their habit. For people that don't have such a habit, something like the ""skip it"" type repetition increment counter, or like a pedometer, but designed to be strapped to the knee. Maybe it would be circular and have a marble that goes around the circumference to count reps while enforcing some sort of form, and  it could have a count of both total reps and longest ""streak"" to make it fun."
