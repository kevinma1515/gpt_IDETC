2. A backpack that contains a motorized pulley system with weights for resistance. The weights are powered through human motion and transferred to the backpack’s internal battery.
""
"3. A pair of shoes with a built-in kinetic energy generator. As the user walks, their steps power the generator, which stores the energy for later use."
""
"4. An adjustable arm band made of a flexible material and embedded kinetic energy harvester. As the user moves their arms, the energy is collected and stored in an internal battery."
""
"5. A pair of kinetic energy harvesting wrist bands that are connected to an exercise machine. As the user moves their arms, it creates resistance and the energy is collected by the bands and stored."
""
"6. A stationary bike with a built-in solar panel. As the user pedals, the solar panel collects energy and feeds it to the machine’s battery."
""
"7. An adjustable elastic belt with a built-in kinetic energy harvester. As the user moves their body, the energy is collected and stored in an internal battery."
""
"8. A hand crank generator attached to an exercise machine. As the user moves the crank, energy is collected and stored in a battery."
""
"9. A set of hand weights with a built-in generator. As the user lifts the weights, energy is collected and stored in an internal battery."
""
"10. A weighted vest with a built-in kinetic energy harvester. As the user moves their body, the energy is collected and stored in an internal battery."
""
"11. An exercise machine with a built-in kinetic energy harvester. As the user moves the machine, the energy is collected and stored in an internal battery."
""
"12. A trampoline with a built-in kinetic energy harvester. As the user jumps, the energy is collected and stored in an internal battery."
""
"13. A pair of adjustable shoes with a built-in kinetic energy harvester. As the user walks or runs, the energy is collected and stored in an internal battery."
""
"14. An adjustable jumpsuit with a built-in kinetic energy harvester. As the user jumps, the energy is collected and stored in an internal battery."
""
"15. An adjustable suspension system with a built-in kinetic energy harvester. As the user swings or moves, the energy is collected and stored in an internal battery."
""
"16. A weighted belt with a built-in kinetic energy harvester. As the user moves their body, the energy is collected and stored in an internal battery."
""
"17. An adjustable ankle bracelet with a built-in kinetic energy harvester. As the user moves their leg, the energy is collected and stored in an internal battery."
""
"18. An adjustable glove with a built-in kinetic energy harvester. As the user moves their wrist, the energy is collected and stored in an internal battery."
""
"19. A set of adjustable dumbbells with a built-in kinetic energy harvester. As the user lifts the dumbbells, the energy is collected and stored in an internal battery."
""
"20. A pair of adjustable socks with a built-in kinetic energy harvester. As the user walks and runs, the energy is collected and stored in an internal battery."
