 This energy can then be used to immobilize a human joint by using a motorized joint in the form of a robotic arm or other robotic joint device.
""
2. A device that uses an exoskeleton of rods and bars to securely and safely immobilize a human joint. The skeletal structure can be easily adjusted or removed as needed and would offer maximum support to the joint.
""
3. A joint immobilization device that uses a vacuum to secure the joint. The user can adjust the amount of suction to ensure maximum immobilization.
""
4. A brace that is designed to fit the exact dimensions of the joint in question. The brace offers a high level of immobilization and is adjustable to the user's specific needs.
""
5. A device that uses magnets to secure the joint in place. Magnets can be arranged in a pattern that fits the user's joint shape and size and offer a high level of immobilization.
""
"6. A device that uses a light-weight, rigid material to secure the joint. The material can be adjusted to provide varying levels of immobilization, while remaining light and comfortable."
""
"7. A device that uses a flexible fabric that wraps around the joint. The fabric is adjustable, so it can provide varying levels of immobilization depending on the desired level of immobilization."
""
8. A device that uses an adjustable metal clamp to secure the joint in place. The metal clamp can be adjusted to provide varying levels of immobilization.
""
"9. A device that uses a combination of rigid and flexible materials to immobilize the joint. The combination of materials can be adjusted to provide varying levels of immobilization, depending on the desired level."
""
"10. A device that uses a combination of a rigid metal frame and a flexible elastomer to immobilize the joint. The metal frame provides the stability and support needed, while the elastomer provides the flexibility and comfort."
